# Donations

We're extremely grateful for all donations, which enable us to continue developing Clipto Pro and keep the major functionality of it for free. However, the core sync capabilities are not free for us. It does not cost us much but every new user increases our expenses. That is why any help is important and we are asking you for it. 

## Contribute Monthly

Monthly donations help keep Clipto Pro development sustainable in the long run.
